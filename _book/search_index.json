To this end, you need to know something about the ingredients that simple programs use, namely variables, vectors/sequences and for-loops. Some of this may have already featured in your statistics or introduction to data science modules, but at this stage, getting some repetition about the sometimes bamboozling inner workings of R certainly does not hurt. Even the most field-oriented among you will use R extensively during your research projects, so the more exposure you can get to this environment, the better. Try to type along with the examples below and see whether they work. Give me a shout if something looks odd. 2.1 Variables A variable provides us with a named storage of data, allowing you to retrieve that bit of data when you want it. A variable in R can contain any type of data (e.g., a single number, a string of text, a vector of multiple values, etc). We assign data to a variable using a = or &lt;- operator (both can be used interchangeably) For example: # create a variable named var.1 and assign a value to it using the &lt;- operator var.1 &lt;- 25000 # create a variable named var.2 and assign a vector, c(), of numbers to it using the = operator var.2 = c(0,1,9.5,200) # a bit of text, surrounded by single &#39;&#39; or double &quot;&quot; quotes some.text &lt;- &quot;Swanpool beach&quot; 2.1.1 Naming variables Variables can have any name, but cannot start with a number and can only contain dot . and underscore _ characters as special characters. # this fails 2times_song_release_year &lt;- 1999 ## Error: &lt;text&gt;:2:2: unexpected symbol ## 1: # this fails ## 2: 2times_song_release_year ## ^ # this is fine release_year_2times &lt;- 1999 # this fails too release%year &lt;- 1999 ## Error: &lt;text&gt;:2:8: unexpected input ## 1: # this fails too ## 2: release%year &lt;- 1999 ## ^ 2.1.2 Changing the value stored by variables You can easily change values of variables, simply by assigning them a new one! The new value can be of a completely different type. # print the value of a variable, showing its current value print(var.1) ## [1] 25000 # change the value var.1 &lt;- &quot;some text instead!&quot; # print the new value print(var.1) ## [1] &quot;some text instead!&quot; You can always check the type of your variable using the class() function: class(var.1) ## [1] &quot;character&quot; class(var.2) ## [1] &quot;numeric&quot; As you see, class() does not tell you that var.2 is a vector of multiple values, but just focuses on the type of the values contained in them (in this case a numeric, which is R’s way of saying that we are dealing with a real number). If you want to find out if something is a vector of values, you have to look at the length of the variable (see below). 2.2 Vectors and element selection As you have seen in the example of var.2 above, variables can point to collections of multiple values (vectors). To create a vector, we use the c() function. We can subsequently get values of (groups of) individual elements by using the [[]] operator: # 1. create a vector of character elements using c() animals &lt;- c(&quot;Opossum&quot;,&quot;Dog&quot;,&quot;Pallas&#39;s leaf warbler&quot;) # 2. select a single element using the double square brackets [[]] print(animals[[3]]) ## [1] &quot;Pallas&#39;s leaf warbler&quot; # 3. obtain a selection of # multiple values using [] and # a vector of elements you want to select print(animals[c(2,3)]) ## [1] &quot;Dog&quot; &quot;Pallas&#39;s leaf warbler&quot; # 4. assign a new value to an existing element animals[[1]] &lt;- &quot;Click beetle&quot; print(animals) ## [1] &quot;Click beetle&quot; &quot;Dog&quot; &quot;Pallas&#39;s leaf warbler&quot; 2.2.1 Exercises What happens to the vector animals if you assign the name of your favorite animal (in quotes \"\", because text) to element 40? Assign the number 0.5 to element 10 of the animals vector. Try to multiply this value by 10, by typing animals[[10]]*10 what happens? Use class(animals[[10]]) to see what is going on. 2.3 Information about your vector You can obtain information about your vector by using a range of different functions, such as sum(): sums all values (only works with numbers obvz) unique() lists all unique values sort() sorts values. and there are lots more. Most often, however, you will use the length() function to obtain its size: length(x=animals) ## [1] 40 2.3.1 Exercise Using the standard iris dataset (available within in R by typing iris on the command line), find out the number of unique values for the column Sepal.Width. If you see iris but don’t know how you can access the column, try to search for it on the web. 2.4 Sequences Vectors are also used to contain sequences of numbers, which can either be generated with the from-to operator : or with the more explicit seq() function: # sequence from 1 to 10 some.seq &lt;- 1:10 # sequence from 10 to 1 reverse.seq &lt;- 10:1 # same, but using the sequence in some.seq and the rev() &#39;reverse&#39; function: reverse.seq.2 &lt;- rev(some.seq) # sequence from 10 to 1, using the seq() function, with a negative increment another.seq &lt;- seq(from=10,to=1,by=-1) # the seq() function is great if you want to take bigger steps: steps.of.5 &lt;- seq(from=3,to=29,by=5) We can also make vectors using repetitions of values, through rep(): # a vector of 300 zeros only.zeros &lt;- rep(x=0,times=300) # a vector of 0,1 values, repeated until a length of 13 is achieved zero.one &lt;- rep(x=c(0,1),length.out=13) 2.5 The important bit: for loops The point about programming is that you want to repeat actions multiple times. To this end, R offers you two different looping constructs: the while() loop and the for loop. In this practical, we focus on the for loop as it is more commonly used than while(). Best to begin by an example: # you need some vector of something # otherwise there will # be nothing to loop over # Here, I use a vector of numbers from 5 up to (&amp; including) 10 some.vec &lt;- 5:10 # component 1: the for statement within # parentheses () for (iterator in some.vec) { # component 2: the for body within curly braces {} # in which tasks # are performed # repeatedly for each value of iterator print(iterator) # I am also printing something else # for the sake of illustration print(&quot;Some text.&quot;) } ## [1] 5 ## [1] &quot;Some text.&quot; ## [1] 6 ## [1] &quot;Some text.&quot; ## [1] 7 ## [1] &quot;Some text.&quot; ## [1] 8 ## [1] &quot;Some text.&quot; ## [1] 9 ## [1] &quot;Some text.&quot; ## [1] 10 ## [1] &quot;Some text.&quot; From the printed output, you see that the iterator gets a new value every time the loop goes round. The message \"Some text\" is also repeatedly printed, but this value does not change. 2.5.1 Dissecting the for loop The loop starts with the keyword for, followed by parentheses (). Within those parentheses, we always start by declaring a new variable, which – in this case – I have called iterator, but you could have given it any valid name, like index or boring.practical. Each time the for loop goes round, the iterator variable gets assigned a new value. Which value? An element from a vector, which we have called here some.vec. The in keyword in between iterator and some.vec performs the assigning of these consecutive elements from some.vec to iterator. Hence, the first time the loop goes round, iterator receives the value of 5, as this is the first element of some.vec. Subsequently, the for loop enters the bit in between curly braces {}. The code in this part will be executed every time iterator gets a new value. In this case, the code is print(iterator), meaning it prints the current value of the iterator variable (which is 5) is printed to the screen. After this the subsequent print() statement is executed, which prints \"Some text\" to the screen. Next, the loop goes round again. Now the value of iterator will be 6. Again, 6 is printed by the print() statements in the {}-part and this goes on until all elements from some.vec have been assigned to iterator. Hence, the last value printed will be 10, after which the for loop exits. 2.5.2 Another example Just to throw in another example that is slightly different, let us calculate the product of elements of two vectors and sum those products: # generate two vectors with numbers; # vectors have the same length vec.1 &lt;- c(0.3,0.9,1.2,0.1,3.5) vec.2 &lt;- c(5,8,12,3,7) # check whether the length is indeed the same stopifnot(length(vec.1) == length(vec.2)) sum &lt;- 0 # loop not over the elements of the list # but over the element indices # (we can do so by creating a list from # 1 to the length of one of the vectors, # i.e., 1,2,3,...) for (idx in 1:length(vec.1)) { # use idx to obtain elements of both vectors # and add them to the total sum &lt;- sum + vec.1[[idx]] * vec.2[[idx]] } print(sum) ## [1] 47.9 2.5.3 Exercises In the first example of a for loop (right below section 2.5), we used the statement for (iterator in some.vec). The statement in the second example of a for loop is slightly more complicated, however: for (idx in 1:length(vec.1)). Can you explain the difference between the two statements? Could you change the code to store the sum that you obtain in each iteration in a list? I.e., that list should have the values print(cumul.list) ## [1] 1.5 8.7 23.1 23.4 47.9 Now that we have some tools under our belts, let’s get going with evolution!!
