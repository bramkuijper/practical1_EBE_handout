This question has been addressed by a simple evolutionary model, called the Hawk-Dove game. This influential model aims to sketch out how aggressive versus more restrained behaviours evolve when individuals compete with each other over resources. Here we analyze a deterministic version of this model, by focusing on a population consisting of i) aggressive hawks (denoted by \\(H\\)) who always fight and do not retreat; and ii) timid Doves (denoted by \\(D\\)), who may perform some threat display, but eventually will always retreat if the other individual starts a fight. 3.1 Payoff matrices We can summarize these interactions in a so-called payoff matrix, where the rows reflect the payoff to a focal player who either plays strategy \\(H\\) or \\(D\\), when it encounters other \\(H\\)s or \\(D\\)s (columns). Table 3.1: The payoff matrix of the Hawk-Dove game. focal \\(\\downarrow\\) opponent \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(H\\) \\(D\\) \\(H\\) \\(\\frac{v-c}{2}\\) \\(v\\) \\(D\\) \\(0\\) \\(\\frac{v}{2}\\) 3.2 Exercise The parameter \\(v\\) clearly has something to do with gaining a resource, while \\(c\\) is a cost. Knowing that, can you explain the biological meaning of each of the payoffs in the table? 3.3 A haploid population genetical model of the Hawk-Dove game Although the Hawk-Dove game is often used as an example of evolutionary game theory, here we start from the ground up by developing a more rigorous model that is based on population genetics. Population genetics deals with genetic detail, so is more complete than evolutionary game theory. However, analyzing the formulas of the population genetics model is slightly more challenging, so this is why we will use R to simulate the model instead. By comparing whether predictions from evolutionary game theory match our population genetics model, we can see whether genetic detail matters, if at all. If predictions do not match, this may tell us that lack genetic assumptions in evolutionary game theory can lead to erroneous conclusions. Such exercises are worthwhile if you want to predict when a phenotypic gambit may be an accurate vs inaccurate description of the evolution of behaviour. 3.4 Lots of crazy assumptions There we go: for the sake of simplicity, we assume that being a hawk or dove is the result of just two alleles at a single haploid locus! Moreover, reproduction occurs asexually. The population sizes are assumed to be infinite. This is crazy of course, hardly any animals are asexual, let alone haploid! Moreover, even fewer are chiefly the result of variation at a single locus only. The question is whether we would learn a similar amount from a hugely convoluted model in which we track the actual population size, have 1000s of loci or deal with sexual reproduction and all the resulting products of recombination? Sure, it would be more realistic! But is it really full-blown reality we are after with this model? If we think the answer is yes, why don’t we study the real world instead? (Last thing I have heard is that the real world is a far more realistic model of reality!). 3.5 Exercise If a model is not meant to exactly replicate reality, what is then the point of making such models? If you think there is no point to any models at all, that is fine too, but argue your case why not. 3.6 Allele frequencies Let \\(p_{t}\\) be the frequency of the allele coding for \\(H\\) in the population at generation \\(t\\), while \\(1-p_{t}\\) is the frequency of the \\(D\\) allele in the population at generation \\(t\\). We assume that strategies are pure, meaning that an individual having the \\(H\\) or \\(D\\) allele will always be a hawk or dove respectively. Later on, we will consider a case where strategies are mixed, so that \\(p_{t}\\) does not reflect the frequency of the \\(H\\) allele, but the probability with which each individual plays \\(H\\) at each interaction. 3.7 Life cycle We assume that generations are discrete, implying that all individuals die after reproduction. Upon birth, a newborn individual fights or displays with other individuals a single time. From this interaction, it will collect a payoff as given in the payoff matrix above. The payoff is then proportional to the number of offspring the individual produces. 3.8 Fitness An individual reproduces according to the payoffs it has collected. Let us denote the absolute fitness of a hawk and a dove as \\(W_{H}\\) and \\(W_{D}\\) respectively, which we can interpret as the expected number of surviving offspring produced by each of these types. Starting with the fitness of a focal dove \\(W_{D,t}\\) at generation \\(t\\), we have \\[\\begin{align} W_{D,t} &amp;= w_{0} + p_{t} (0) + \\left(1-p_{t} \\right) \\frac{v}{2} \\end{align}\\] the first element on the right-hand side, \\(w_{0}\\) reflects the so-called ‘baseline fitness’, which is the fitness that this individual accrues during other activities than displaying. It is assumed that baseline fitness is similar for hawks and doves. the second part reflects the probability that a focal dove meets a hawk (hawks are encountered with a frequency of \\(p_{t}\\)). The focal dove will then immediately retreat, hence collecting no payoff (but also incurring no costs), reflected by the \\((0)\\). the third part reflects the probability that a focal dove meets another dove (doves are encountered with a frequency of \\(1-p_{t}\\)). In that case they will split the value of the resource, hence \\(v/2\\). 3.9 Exercise Based on similar reasoning as for \\(W_{D,t}\\) above, can you write down the fitness expression \\(W_{H,t}\\) for a focal hawk in generation \\(t\\)? Again, assume that there is some baseline fitness \\(w_{0}\\) accrued from other activities than fighting: \\[\\begin{align} W_{H,t} &amp;= w_{0} + \\ldots + \\ldots \\end{align}\\] Can you say something about the possible values that fitnesses of hawks \\(W_{H,t}\\) and doves \\(W_{D,t}\\) can attain? For example, can an individual have a fitness of \\(0.5\\) (or can fitness values only be integers)? And a fitness value of \\(-1\\), would that be possible? Or a fitness value of \\(1e08\\)? 3.10 Evolutionary dynamics Now that we have derived fitness expressions of the dove and hawk alleles, let us consider how the frequencies of these alleles change over time. The frequency \\(p_{t+1}\\) of the hawk allele at time \\(t+1\\) is given by a surprisingly simple equation: \\[\\begin{align} p_{t+1} &amp;= p_{t} \\frac{W_{H}}{\\bar{W}_{t}} \\end{align}\\] This is a so-called recursion equation, tracking an allele frequency recursively from one generation to the next. Keep an eye on this equation, as we will need it later on. The term \\(\\bar{W}_{t}\\) in the expression above is the average arithmetic fitness in the population in generation \\(t\\), given by \\[\\begin{align} \\bar{W} &amp;= p_{t} W_{H} + \\left(1 - p_{t} \\right ) W_{D} \\end{align}\\] The expression for \\(p_{t+1}\\) above tells you that if hawks do better than the average (\\(W_{H} &gt; \\bar{W}\\)), the frequency of the hawk allele will increase from one generation to the next, as \\(W_{H}/\\bar{W} &gt; 1\\). Similarly, if hawks do worse than average, we have \\(W_{H}/\\bar{W} &lt; 1\\) and the frequency of the hawk allele decreases. One advantage of our super-simple model is that we do not have derive a separate expression for the change in frequency of the dove allele!! This is simply \\(1-p_{t+1}\\). However, if we would consider more than two alleles per locus (or multiple loci), matters would be (far) more difficult. 3.11 Relation to \\(\\Delta p\\) in lecture slides (this section is optional) In the lecture slides we have seen that the change in allele frequency was given by \\[\\begin{align} \\Delta p = p_{t+1} - p_{t} = p_{t} \\left ( 1 - p_{t} \\right ) \\frac{ W_{H} - W_{D}}{\\bar{W}} \\end{align}\\] If you want to know how the above relates to the equation we have seen in the lecture slides, read this! If not interested, please skip ahead to the next section. How do we get from our recursion equation $p_{t+1} = $ to the one above? The clue is in the \\(\\Delta p = p_{t+1} - p_{t}\\). If we substitute here for our recursion equation of \\(p_{t+1}\\), we get: \\[\\begin{align} \\Delta p &amp;= p_{t+1} - p_{t} \\\\ &amp;= p_{t} \\frac{W_{H}}{\\bar{W}_{t}} - p_{t} \\quad \\text{substitute for }p_{t+1} \\\\ &amp;= p_{t} \\frac{W_{H}}{\\bar{W}_{t}} - p_{t} \\frac{\\bar{W_{t}}}{\\bar{W}_{t}} \\quad \\text{common demoninator} \\\\ &amp;= p_{t} \\frac{W_{H}}{\\bar{W}_{t}} - p_{t} \\frac{p_{t} W_{H} + \\left (1 - p_{t}\\right ) W_{D} }{\\bar{W}_{t}} \\quad \\text{expanding }\\bar{W} \\\\ &amp;= p_{t} \\left (1 - p_{t} \\right ) \\frac{W_{H}}{\\bar{W}_{t}} - p_{t} \\frac{\\left (1 - p_{t}\\right ) W_{D} }{\\bar{W}_{t}} \\quad \\text{clubbing terms of }W_{H} \\\\ &amp;= p_{t} \\left (1 - p_{t} \\right ) \\frac{W_{H} - W_{D}}{\\bar{W}_{t}} \\quad \\text{clubbing terms of }p_{t} \\left(1-p_{t} \\right) \\\\ \\end{align}\\] and we are done. A bit of algebra to show that \\(p_{t+1}\\) and \\(\\Delta p\\) are just two sides of the same coin, the first one is a recursion equation, the second one a difference equation. 3.12 Exercise: implementing your first evolutionary algorithm in R In order to asses whether hawks or doves win out in the long term, in this exercise we are going to build our own evolutionary model! The goal is to iterate the population genetics recursion equation \\(p_{t+1} = p_{t} W_{H} / \\bar{W}\\) that you encountered before. We do so over a large bunch of time steps, so that we can see what happens with evolving populations like these in the long term: Will hawks win or doves? Will both happily coexist? Will frequencies fluctuate over time? Do evolutionary changes happen rapidly or slowly? All pretty important questions if we want to say something about how animals adapt to the behaviours of others. The for loop that we encountered before is just the ideal tool for such a task! For example, by having a for statement like for (t in 1:max_time) we can make a variable t that takes the value \\(t=1\\), \\(t=2\\), \\(t=3\\)…,\\(t=\\)max_time in steps of 1. This is a great way to keep track of subsequent generations. Moreover, using the recursion equation, we can then calculate the frequency of the hawk allele in these different generations. To get you started, I provide a part of an R-script below. The task at hand is to update the recursion equation \\(p_{t+1} = p_{t} W_{H} / \\bar{W}\\) during every iteration of the for loop: # broken code on the evolution of hawks vs doves # we intend to iterate the haploid population genetics # recursion p(t+1) = p(t)*... # but quite some things are missing # parameters coding the payoffs c &lt;- 2.0 # baseline fitness w0 &lt;- 10 # maximum time the simulation should run for max_time &lt;- 1000 # a vector containing allele frequencies # for all time steps p &lt;- rep(x=NA, times=max_time) # set the initial frequency of the hawks # at time step 1 p[[1]] &lt;- 0.5 # a for loop to iterate the recursion equation # over multiple timesteps for (time_idx in ) { # calculate fitness of a dove wD &lt;- w0 + p[[time_idx]] * 0 + (1-p[[time_idx]]) * v/2 # calculate mean fitness wBar &lt;- wD * (1 - p[[time_idx]]) + wH * # recursion equation } 3.13 Exercise If your model works, try to explore what happens when you vary the parameter values \\(v\\) and \\(c\\). And what happens when you vary the value of the baseline fitness \\(w_{0}\\)? Can you try to make a plot of your results, either using \\(R\\) or Excel? 3.14 Exercise Can you try to run your script multiple times, each time for a different initial value of the frequency of hawks? Does it matter where you start? Can you plot the output from your simulation either in \\(R\\) or in Excel? Plotting in R can be done with plot(x=1:max_time ,y=p ,ylim=c(0,1.0) ,xlab=&quot;generation&quot; ,ylab=&quot;frequency Hawk allele&quot;) 3.15 Exercise From evolutionary game theory, we know that the equilibrium frequency \\(\\hat{p}\\) of hawks (i.e., the frequency at which there is no further change in the frequency of hawks) is \\(\\hat{p} = v/c\\). Do you get the same answer here? What would you conclude about the importance of genetic detail?
