# An evolutionary model of the hawk-dove game

In your previous studies you may have come across a simple evolutionary model, 
called the Hawk-Dove game. This influential model aims to sketch out how 
aggressive versus more restrained behaviours evolve 
when individuals compete with each other over resources. 

Here we analyze a deterministic version of this
model, by focusing on a population consisting of i) aggressive hawks (denoted by $H$) who
always fight and do not retreat; and ii) timid Doves (denoted by $D$), who may perform some
threat display, but eventually will always retreat if the other individual
starts a fight. 

## Payoff matrices
We can summarize these interactions in a so-called payoff matrix:
\begin{align}
        & H & D \\
  H \text{ encounters...} \quad & \frac{v-c}{2} & v \\
  D \text{ encounters...} \quad & 0 & \frac{v}{2}
\end{align}




Here we are going to develop our own hawk dove model in R and investigate how 
it plays out, using what we call a *deterministic* model where 



A key element of this model is that the fitness payoff of a strategy one plays depends on the 
Until the 1970s, most evolutionary models considered traits 


# Fitness of a hawk
For the sake of simplicity, we assume that being a hawk or dove is the result
of alleles at a single haploid locus.
This is crazy of course, hardly any animal traits are haploid! Moreover, even
fewer are chiefly the result of variation at a single locus only.

This is what typical models are about: sure, the assumptions are wrong, but
deep insights in evolutionary biology typically come from 
overly simplistic models as these are at least understandable. The insights of
the Hawk-Dove game would have been much more poorly understood if 


Let $p$ be the frequency of hawks in the population, while $1-p$ is the frequency of doves in the population. 
For the sake of simplicity, we are going to assume that 

## Exercise
* Can hawks invade in a full dove population?
* Can doves invade in a full dove population?
